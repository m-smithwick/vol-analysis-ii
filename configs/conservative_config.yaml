# Conservative Risk Configuration
# Capital preservation via trend protection - Lower drawdowns prioritized over maximum returns
# Based on backtest results: 259% return, -23.9% max drawdown, 2.09x W/L ratio, 73.8% monthly win rate

config_name: "conservative"
config_version: "1.1"
description: "Conservative: Higher entry thresholds (6.5), no time stops, strict regime filters (SPY+sector). Uses standard exit signals (profit taking, momentum exhaustion, distribution warning). Best for: Capital preservation, risk-averse traders, smaller accounts."

# ⚠️⚠️⚠️ MA_CROSSDOWN EXIT STRATEGY - DEPRECATED ⚠️⚠️⚠️
# This exit strategy has been DISABLED based on empirical evidence from Dec 2025 backtesting.
#
# EVIDENCE (Full cycle test: Mar 2022 - Dec 2025):
# - INCREASED max drawdown from -36.97% to -52.77% (43% WORSE, not better!)
# - REDUCED win rate from 53.7% to 44.1% (lost 403 winning trades)
# - REDUCED total return from 307.72% to 264.19%
# - REDUCED Sharpe ratio from 1.62 to 1.34
# - Created excessive whipsaws in volatile markets (2022 bear market)
#
# WHY IT FAILED:
# 1. 50-day MA too close to price - triggers on normal volatility, not real trend breaks
# 2. Cuts winning positions during healthy pullbacks
# 3. Forces exits that prevent positions from recovering
# 4. Re-entry after whipsaw creates "buy high, sell low" pattern
#
# RECOMMENDATION: Use standard exit signals instead (they work better):
# - Profit Taking: Captures gains at appropriate levels
# - Momentum Exhaustion: Exits when upward momentum fades
# - Distribution Warning: Exits on confirmed distribution
# - Stop Loss: Hard stop for risk management
#
# FULL ANALYSIS: See backtest_comparison_all_three_configs.txt
# DO NOT RE-ENABLE unless you have new evidence contradicting these results.
