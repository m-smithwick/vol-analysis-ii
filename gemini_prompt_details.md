# Gemini Prompt Analysis

## The Exact Prompt Being Used

Here's the complete prompt from `fetch_financial_news_from_gemini()` function in `news_influence.py`:

```
Please provide REAL financial news for {ticker} stock from {start_date} to {end_date}.

IMPORTANT: If you don't have information about real news for this ticker during this period, return an empty array [].
DO NOT generate fictional or made-up news. Only return news you know is real.

For each news item, include:
1. Timestamp (in ISO format with time - example: "2025-10-15T09:30:00")
2. Headline
3. Brief summary
4. Source (like Bloomberg, CNBC, etc.)
5. Estimated sentiment (number between -1.0 and 1.0 where negative is bad news and positive is good news)
6. Relevance to the ticker (number between 0.0 and 1.0)

Return ONLY valid JSON format like:
[
    {"timestamp": "2025-10-15T09:30:00", "headline": "Example Headline", "summary": "Brief summary", "source": "Source Name", "sentiment": 0.5, "relevance": 0.9}
]

If no real news is available, return [].
```

## Prompt Analysis

### ‚úÖ Good Aspects:
1. **Anti-hallucination instructions**: Explicitly tells Gemini not to generate fake news
2. **Clear format specification**: Requests structured JSON output
3. **Fallback handling**: Tells it to return `[]` if no real news exists
4. **Detailed requirements**: Specifies all needed fields (timestamp, headline, etc.)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues:
1. **Knowledge cutoff**: Gemini has limited knowledge of recent events
2. **Real-time limitation**: AI models don't have access to live news feeds
3. **Date specificity**: Asking for very specific date ranges that may not align with training data

### üìä Test Results Show:
- **Recent dates (Oct 2024-2025)**: Returns `[]` (no news available)
- **Historical dates (2023-early 2024)**: Returns actual news items
- **Response format**: Properly formatted JSON when data is available

## Why It's Not Working for Recent Dates

The prompt itself is well-designed, but **Gemini simply doesn't have access to recent financial news data**. This is expected behavior for AI language models that:

1. Have training data cutoffs
2. Don't connect to live news APIs
3. Are designed to avoid generating fictional financial information

## Recommendation

The prompt is fine - the issue is the data source limitation. To fix this:

1. **Use Alpha Vantage API** for recent news (already integrated as fallback)
2. **Use historical dates** where Gemini has data (2023-early 2024)
3. **Consider the prompt successful** since it correctly returns `[]` when no real data exists
