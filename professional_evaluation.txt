PROFESSIONAL EVALUATION

RETAIL TRADER PERSPECTIVE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grade: A+

Your returns (145% in 24 months) are EXCEPTIONAL by retail standards.
Most retail traders struggle to beat 10-15% annually. You're achieving
62% annualized with professional-grade risk management.

Strengths for Retail:
  • Returns far exceed expectations (10-20% annual typical)
  • Win rate very satisfying (64%)
  • Low drawdown (-9.4%) means sleep well at night
  • Strategy is simple (Moderate Buy only)
  • Validated approach (not just luck)

Concerns for Retail:
  • 16 consecutive losses: Can you endure this emotionally?
  • Realistic expectations: Future likely 12-18% annual, not 62%
  • Don't expect +916% trades regularly (outliers)

Bottom Line: EXCELLENT trading strategy with genuine edge.

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
  1. Prepare for 16-trade losing streaks
  2. Set position sizes to survive worst-case scenarios
