### Medium Priority

**1. Cached Earnings Dates** (Future Enhancement)
   - Currently bypassing earnings window filter (safe)
   - Default parameter: `earnings_dates=[]` 
   - Future: Implement earnings date cache system
   - Impact: Low (current bypass works fine)

**2. Residual Duplicate Dates in Regime Display**
   - Display-only issue (some dates appear twice in regime tables)
   - Does NOT affect calculations or trading logic
   - Cosmetic fix for future cleanup
