## 📊 Backtesting System

The backtesting feature validates signal performance by analyzing actual entry-to-exit trade pairs using historical data.

### **Entry-to-Exit Paired Analysis**

Matches each entry signal with its corresponding exit signal to simulate real trading:
- **Actual holding periods**: Real days between entry and exit
- **True returns**: Entry price to exit price performance
- **Strategy comparison**: Identifies most profitable entry/exit combinations
- **Real-world simulation**: Models how trades would actually execute

## 📊 Technical Indicators Used

### **On-Balance Volume (OBV)**
- Cumulative volume indicator showing money flow
- **Bullish**: OBV rising while price flat/declining
- **Bearish**: OBV falling while price rising

### **Accumulation/Distribution Line**
- Measures the cumulative flow of money into/out of security
- Uses intraday price action relative to close
- **Formula**: `((Close - Low) - (High - Close)) / (High - Low) * Volume`

### **Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**
- Average price weighted by volume
- **Above VWAP**: Generally bullish positioning
- **Below VWAP**: Generally bearish positioning

### **Support Level Detection**
- 20-day rolling minimum low price
- **Near Support**: Within 5% of support level
- **Significance**: Potential bounce/accumulation zone

### **Dual Scoring System**

#### **Entry Score (0-10 scale)**
Points awarded for:
- **A/D Line divergence**: +2 points
- **OBV trend divergence**: +2 points  
- **Volume spike**: +1 point
- **Above VWAP**: +1 point
- **Near support**: +1 point

#### **Exit Score (1-10 scale)**
Points awarded for:
- **Distribution phase**: +2 points
- **Below VWAP**: +1.5 points
- **Below support**: +2 points
- **High volume (>2.5x)**: +1.5 points
- **Declining A/D line**: +1 point
- **Declining OBV**: +1 point
- **Low accumulation**: +1 point

**Final scores**: Normalized and clipped to respective scales

## 🎯 Stealth Accumulation Ranking System (NEW)

The batch processing feature uses a **Recent Stealth Activity Score** instead of traditional averages to identify stocks with fresh institutional buying that haven't broken out yet.

### **Stealth Scoring Algorithm (0-10 scale)**

**Recent Stealth Signals** (0-4 points):
- Counts stealth accumulation signals in the last 10 trading days
- Multiple recent signals = higher score

**Signal Recency** (0-3 points):
- Days since the last stealth accumulation signal
- More recent signals = higher score
- Recent (≤2 days) gets maximum points

**Price Containment** (0-3 points):
- Price appreciation during the stealth accumulation period
- Lower price gains = higher score (ideal for stealth buying)
- ≤2% gain = 3 points, ≤5% gain = 2 points, ≤10% gain = 1 point

### **Batch Processing Ranking Display**
```
🎯 TOP STEALTH ACCUMULATION CANDIDATES (by recent activity):
   1. AMZN  - Stealth:  8.0/10 🎯 (Last: Recent, Recent: 1, Price: +0.0%, Total: 1)
   2. AI    - Stealth:  5.3/10 💎 (Last: Recent, Recent: 1, Price: +9.5%, Total: 1)
   3. MSFT  - Stealth:  0.0/10 💤 (Last: None, Recent: 0, Price: +0.0%, Total: 0)
```

**Explanation**:
- **Stealth Score**: Recent activity score (0-10)
- **Last**: Days since last stealth signal ("Recent" = ≤2 days)
- **Recent**: Count of stealth signals in last 10 days
- **Price**: Price change during stealth accumulation period
- **Total**: Total stealth signals across entire analysis period

### **Stealth Score Emojis**
- 🎯 **7-10**: High recent stealth activity - prime candidates
- 💎 **5-7**: Moderate recent stealth activity
- 👁️ **3-5**: Low recent stealth activity
- 💤 **0-3**: No meaningful recent stealth activity

## 🔍 Multi-Timeframe Analysis

Use the `--multi` flag to analyze across multiple timeframes:

```bash
python vol_analysis.py AAPL --multi
```

**Analyzes**: 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year periods
**Output**: Consensus strength rating and average accumulation activity

**Interpretation**:
- **🔥 VERY STRONG**: Average score ≥6 across timeframes
- **⚡ STRONG**: Average score ≥4 across timeframes  
- **💡 MODERATE**: Average score ≥2 across timeframes
- **❄️ WEAK**: Average score <2 across timeframes

## 📋 Sample Output Interpretation

```
🎯 ENTRY SIGNAL SUMMARY:
  🟢 Strong Buy Signals: 2 (Large green dots - Score ≥7, near support, above VWAP)
  🟡 Moderate Buy Signals: 5 (Medium yellow dots - Score 5-7, divergence signals)
  💎 Stealth Accumulation: 3 (Cyan diamonds - High score, low volume)
  ⭐ Multi-Signal Confluence: 1 (Magenta stars - All indicators aligned)
  🔥 Volume Breakouts: 0 (Orange triangles - 2.5x+ volume)

🚪 EXIT SIGNAL SUMMARY:
  🟠 Profit Taking: 1 (Orange dots - New highs with waning accumulation)
  ⚠️ Distribution Warning: 0 (Gold squares - Early distribution signs)
  🔴 Sell Signals: 0 (Red dots - Strong distribution below VWAP)
  💜 Momentum Exhaustion: 0 (Purple X's - Rising price, declining volume)
  🛑 Stop Loss Triggers: 0 (Dark red triangles - Support breakdown)
```

**Analysis**: This shows a stock in accumulation phase with multiple entry signals, minimal exit pressure, and one profit-taking opportunity. Low exit score indicates position is stable for continued holding.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **"No module named 'yfinance'"**
```bash
pip install yfinance
```

#### **Charts too small/large**
- Chart size optimized for 16-inch Mac displays
- Modify `figsize=(12, 9)` in code if needed

#### **Emoji warnings in plots**
- Cosmetic font warnings, doesn't affect functionality
- Charts will display properly despite warnings

#### **Invalid ticker symbol**
```
❌ Error analyzing XYZ: No data found, symbol may be delisted
```
- Verify ticker symbol is correct and actively traded
- Use proper exchange format (e.g., `BRK-A` not `BRKA`)

### **Performance Tips**
- Use shorter periods (`3mo`, `6mo`) for faster analysis
- Daily intervals only - simplified for closing price analysis
- Longer periods provide more reliable signals

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### **Signal Quality**
- **Look for clusters**: Multiple signals in same area = higher confidence
- **Confirm with volume**: Best signals have supporting volume patterns
- **Watch divergences**: OBV/A/D rising while price flat = accumulation

### **Complete Trading System**
- **Entry Strategy**: Use entry signals (🟢🟡💎⭐🔥) for position initiation
- **Exit Strategy**: Monitor exit signals (🟠⚠️🔴💜🛑) for position management
- **Signal Transitions**: Watch for Entry→Hold→Exit phase changes

### **Exit Score Interpretation**
- **8-10**: 🚨 URGENT - Consider immediate exit
- **6-8**: ⚠️ HIGH RISK - Reduce position size significantly
- **4-6**: 💡 MODERATE RISK - Monitor closely
- **2-4**: ✅ LOW RISK - Normal monitoring
- **1-2**: 🟢 MINIMAL RISK - Position looks healthy
