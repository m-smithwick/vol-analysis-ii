## 💎 STEALTH ACCUMULATION PERFORMANCE (DEPRECATED)

**⚠️ NOTE:** This signal FAILED out-of-sample validation - included for reference only.

| Metric | ibd.txt | ibd20.txt | ltl.txt |
|--------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Win Rate | 53.2% | 44.8% | 53.0% |
| Median | +2.29% | -2.37% | +0.75% |
| Closed Trades | 205 | 145 | 117 |

**All three lists show Stealth issues:**
- ibd.txt: Looked best but failed 6mo validation (22.7%)
- ibd20: Already losing on 24mo data (-2.37% median)
- ltl: Barely breakeven (+0.75% median)

**Conclusion:** Stealth doesn't work well on ANY of these lists.

## 📈 TOTAL STRATEGY PERFORMANCE

### Trade Generation (24 Months):

| List | Total Trades | Closed | Open | Trades/Ticker |
|------|--------------|--------|------|---------------|

| ibd20.txt | 422 | 409 | 13 | 20.5 |

**Observations:**
- **ibd.txt generates most closed trades** (573 vs 409 vs 321)

## 💡 WHY VOLATILITY MATTERS

### Pullback Strategy Requirements:

The Moderate Buy Pullback strategy needs:
1. **Clear uptrends** (to pullback from)
2. **Moderate volatility** (creates pullback opportunities)  
3. **Quick recoveries** (exits resolve profitably)

**ibd.txt provides this perfectly:**
- Growth stocks have strong trends
- Enough volatility for meaningful pullbacks
- Quick moves back up after pullback

**ltl.txt fails because:**
- Too stable = no pullbacks
- Grinds higher = no entry opportunities
- When they do pullback, it's a problem not an opportunity

## 🔄 HISTORICAL CONTEXT

### Why This Comparison Matters:

**Previous Assumption:**
"IBD curated lists are better than my own picks"

**Reality Check:**
Your custom list (ibd.txt) actually outperforms IBD's professional selections:
- +2.4% higher win rate than Big Cap 20
- +5.49% better median than Long Term Leaders
- More trade opportunities

**Key Insight:** 
Stock picking for THIS SPECIFIC STRATEGY is different from general stock selection. IBD's Long Term Leaders are great stocks, but they don't create good pullback opportunities.

## 💼 POSITION SIZING IMPLICATIONS

### Expected Trades Per Year:

| List | Moderate Buy/Year | Annual Opportunities |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| ibd.txt | ~156 | ~13 per month |
| ibd20.txt | ~125 | ~10 per month |
| ltl.txt | ~73 | ~6 per month |

**Capital Efficiency:**
- ibd.txt: Most opportunities (13/month)
- ibd20.txt: Good opportunities (10/month)
- ltl.txt: Limited opportunities (6/month)

**Implication:**

**ibd.txt:**
- ✅ Multi-ticker validation (24 tickers, 24mo)
- ✅ Out-of-sample testing (6mo forward)
- ✅ Signal redesign and optimization
- **Status:** FULLY VALIDATED

**ibd20.txt:**
- ✅ This 24mo backtest
- ⚠️ No out-of-sample testing yet
- ⚠️ No multi-ticker optimization
- **Status:** PARTIALLY VALIDATED (looks good but needs confirmation)

**ltl.txt:**
- ✅ This 24mo backtest  
- ❌ Poor performance = no further testing needed
- **Status:** NOT SUITABLE for pullback strategy

## 🎲 OUTLIER ANALYSIS

### Mean vs Median Comparison:

| List | Mean | Median | Ratio | Outlier Impact |

| ibd20.txt | +8.36% | +4.59% | **1.8x** | MODERATE |
| ltl.txt | +2.84% | -0.28% | **-10x** | EXTREME ⚠️ |

**Analysis:**
- **ibd.txt:** Big winners (QUBT +662%) inflate mean significantly
- **ibd20.txt:** More consistent, less outlier distortion
- **ltl.txt:** Few big wins can't overcome steady small losses

**Trading Implication:**
- ibd.txt: Expect +5% typical, occasional home run
- ibd20.txt: Expect +4-5% typical, steadier
- ltl.txt: Don't use - even outliers can't save it
